# Simple-neural-network-on-GPU-with-CUDA

Both cpu and gpu version of network are available.

This network has 1000 neurons in midle layer and uses the mnist dataset.
There is a detailed presentation about cpu vs gpu programming called GPU ACCELERATION.pdf that exaplanes more the code and gpu acceleration in general  

There is also a detailed google colab notebook so you can run the code in there and compare times.
